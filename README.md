# ESP32S3 Robot Car Implementation

This project is about creating a robot car that can be controlled by a [remote](https://github.com/kaizen42u/ESP32S3-REMOTE) using **ESP-NOW** protocol. ESP-NOW is a peer-to-peer communication protocol that allows devices to send and receive data without connecting to a Wi-Fi network. This project supports multiple remote connections (up to 6 concurrent) to the same robot car.

## Features

- Robot car with two wheels, two motors, and a battery
- ESP32S3 module with built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
- ESP-NOW protocol for fast and reliable communication
- Multiple remote connections to the same robot car
- RSSI for pairing
- PID closed-loop control

## Requirements

- Hardware:
  - Robot car kit with chassis, wheels, motors, and battery
  - ESP32S3 module
  - Breadboard and wires
- Software:
  - Visual Studio Code
  - ESP-IDF Version 1.7.0

## Installation

- Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Install [ESP-IDF extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=espressif.esp-idf-extension)
- Connect the ESP32S3 module to your computer using USB cables
- Open the sketch in Visual Studio Code
- Select the correct board (ESP32S3 Dev Module) and port
- Upload the sketche to the ESP32S3 module

## Usage

- Turn on the robot car and the remote
- Hold the remote close to the robot car and start pressing buttons
- Wait for the ESP-NOW connection to be established
- Use the joystick and the buttons on the remote to control the robot car
- Enjoy!
